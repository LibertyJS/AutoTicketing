# AutoTicketing
## Synopsis

This repo contains a node.js app that speaks with the twitter api and the
Liberty JS backend to confirm attendees and print their tickets upon arrival
at the LibertyJS event.


## Motivation

This application was created in an effort to create a prototype that should help
the checkin process at a conference much easier for both organizers and attendees.

## Installation

forthcoming. We have yet to build the app :-)
